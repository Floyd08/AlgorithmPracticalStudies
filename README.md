# AlgorithmPracticalStudies

This is a barebones code library I built for a course in algorithm design and analysis. I found it helpful to be able to watch the alogrtihm work, so many of these are implemented such that this is possible. 

I enjoyed the class, and have been adding to the library whenever I read about an algorithm that sounds fun.
